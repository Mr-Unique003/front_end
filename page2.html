                    Concept Of Institute
                </h2>
                <p>

                   
                    
                    People's University is a leading service provider to students preparing for National Level Entrance Exams. Our Instiyute is a 30-year-old institute offering programs for various competitive exams Although it’s not really part of our name, we are proud that People's University is popular as an Learning Institute.’ Yes, it’s not just another coaching institute or training institute. We like to think of People's University as an Learning Institute because we see ourselves as providers of education which is complementary, or sometimes even supplementary, to what is provided in regular schools and junior colleges. We are not in the market only to drive people towards engineering- or medical-based entrances but to provide students with the skills and knowledge they require to carve out lucrative and socially responsible careers for themselves.
                    
                    Traditionally “Academy” referred to a garden or grove near Athens called Akademia (so named after the hero Academus) and a sanctuary of Athena, the goddess of wisdom and skill, where Plato founded his school of philosophy approximately in 385 BC and where he held philosophical conferences with his followers. Today, it means an institute of higher learning of quality and standard. We are happy that over the 30 years it has been in the market, this University has proved itself to be a true academy of learning and culture. Our ultimate intention is to partner mainline education providers with expertise in education that is in line with market realities and expectations thereby ensuring that the students get a well rounded education and the best possible opportunities to prepare them for a fulfilling life.
